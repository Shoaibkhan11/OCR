This repository contains a comprehensive Optical Character Recognition (OCR) project utilizing EasyOCR, a powerful and user-friendly OCR library. The project demonstrates how to effectively extract text from images using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.
The library utilizes a combination of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and CNNs to accurately recognize characters within the detected text regions.
